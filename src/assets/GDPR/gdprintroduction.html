            <h3 class="subheadgdpr">GDPR Introduction </h3> 
            
            <p class="fontmed">
            The European Union (EU) has some of the strictest data protection laws in the world. 
            These laws aim to uphold the fundamental principle that all individuals in the EU have a 
            right to privacy and to the protection of information relating to them (personal data).  
            The applicable legislation in the UK is currently the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), 
            which was enacted following the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).
            
            </p>
            
            <p class="fontmed">
            Due to rapid developments in technology, increasing amounts of personal 
            data are being created and processed about all of us. 
            As publicised in the media, there are also increased risks posed to such data by data security breaches, 
            cyberattacks and data fraud.  The DPA is no longer fit for purpose.
            </p>
            
            <p class="fontmed">
            In response to these developments and risks, the EU introduced a new EU data protection law, 
            which came into force on 24 May 2016 and will be enforced in full from 25 May 2018. 
            This law is known as the ‘General Data Protection Regulation’ (GDPR).  
            In terms of EU law, a ‘Regulation’ (unlike a ‘Directive’, which is what 
            the DPA is based upon) applies directly in member states largely without 
            the need to local implementing legislation.  
            Therefore, from 25 May 2018, GDPR will be fully in force in the UK.
            </p>
            
            <p class="fontmed"> Of course, following the terms of Brexit being agreed with the EU, 
            GDPR will at some point in the future cease to apply directly in the UK.  
            However, a new Data Protection Bill (Bill) is currently making its way through Parliament.  
            As well as dealing with certain elements of processing that do not form part of EU law, 
            implementing the EU’s Law Enforcement Directive, covering elements of National Security and 
            specific aspects of the roles and functions of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), 
            the Bill also largely replicates / incorporates the text of GDPR.  
            Consequently, the provisions of GDPR will continue to apply in the UK following Brexit.</p>
            
            <h3 class="subheadgdpr margintop10">Importance of GDPR</h3>
            
            <p class="fontmed">The GDPR will create the strictest data protection laws in the world and will be underpinned by 
            robust enforcement powers. These powers will allow the regulatory authorities not only to impose very 
            large fines but also to stop or change the way in which a non-compliant business operates.  
            Organisations such as yours handle personal data relating to your patients on a daily basis. 
            You will therefore be subject to more onerous obligations in the way that you handle such personal data and 
            individuals will have much stronger rights in relation to your use of their personal data.</p>
            
            <p class="fontmed">Your patients will expect you to meet the strict new standards set by the GDPR. 
            If you do not meet the necessary standards set by the GDPR then you could be exposed 
            to very onerous sanctions and this could be detrimental to you 
            not only financially but also to your reputation and the success of your practice. </p>
